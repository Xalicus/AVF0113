            <h3>Data Research, Project Intent</h3>
            <p id="wk2"><strong>1. Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include 
            logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br /><br />
            With not ever really wanting a Twitter account, I don't know to much about it, 
            just that it's a microblogging site. I have seen other websites asking for 
            people to login with their Facebook accounts, and I'm sure Twitter would be the 
            same way. Logging in with your Twitter account would allow you to not have to 
            create a new account, and be great for authentications, but I'm not sure about 
            payments, since I've never used Twitter. I would guess with payments it would 
            be about the same, as long as Twitter saves payment information though.<br /><br />
            <strong>2. Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why 
            would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong><br /><br />
            JSON-P data is great for APIs, because it is like it was made for it. The fact 
            that JSONP is used for cross-origin client-side callbacks, makes it the best 
            case for APIs, so you can get data from a second website, when you're currently 
            at the first website.<br /><br />
            <strong>3. Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think 
            might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br /><br />
            I can see the Camera and Geolocation being paired to the native device feature, 
            and with the jsonp data feature. It would work great as you can use the devices 
            camera, geolocate the place it was taken, and then post it to a social site, 
            like Twitter or Facebook.<br /><br />
            <strong>4. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have 
            for your Demo app components this month.</strong><br /><br />
            For my demo app, I was thinking of adding the camera with geolocation component 
            to add video or pictures of your paranormal activities you happen to capture. 
            I would like to add integration with youtube also, and Facebook, so you can 
            upload those pictures and video to either one. I suppose I need to add Twitter 
            to the list, so I'll do that, so you can Tweet where the next ghost hunt will 
            be at.<br /><br />
            <strong>5. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it 
            relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br /><br />
            Workflow is a crazy concept to me. I have always procrastinated throughout my 
            high school and college years. I do try and work on things within the time that 
            is allotted to me, and sometimes I even had to get assignments in early, because 
            I had to work all day when the assignments were due. But otherwise I usually 
            wait until the last day, like today I did, to work on my assignments.</p>
